# Security Log Analyzer

## Requirements:

1. **Log Types**: Analyze firewall logs, system logs (e.g., syslog), and web server logs (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to identify security events and anomalies.
2. **Log Sources**: Collect logs from multiple sources, including network devices, servers, and web applications.
3. **Log Formats**: Support common log formats such as JSON, CSV, or plaintext logs.
4. **Security Events**: Detect and flag security events like failed login attempts, port scanning, SQL injection attempts, unauthorized access attempts, and suspicious traffic patterns.
5. **Filtering and Aggregation**: Provide the ability to filter logs based on various attributes like timestamp, source IP, destination IP, event type, or severity level. Also, aggregate logs based on criteria such as IP address, user, or specific time intervals.
6. **Correlation**: Perform log correlation to identify relationships and patterns across different log entries and sources. Correlate logs to uncover potential attack sequences or identify coordinated attacks.
7. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations, graphs, and charts to display statistical information, trends, and summaries of identified security events.

## Objectives:

1. **Enhanced Threat Detection**: Improve the detection and identification of security incidents by analysing logs for potential threats and anomalies.
2. **Real-time Processing**: Process logs in near real-time to enable prompt detection and response to security events.
3. **Scalability**: Design the analyzer to handle large volumes of logs efficiently and scale horizontally to accommodate increasing log loads.
4. **Flexibility and Customization**: Allow configuration options to support different log formats, event definitions, and filtering criteria. Enable users to customize the tool according to their specific needs.
5. **Alerting and Reporting**: Implement alerting mechanisms to notify security teams of critical security events in real-time. Generate comprehensive reports with detailed insights and summaries of identified security events.

These requirements and objectives are just examples. Feel free to modify and adapt them based on your specific needs and preferences for the Security Log Analyzer project.

## Development Environment Setup & Python Project Initialization

Follow the steps below to set up your development environment:

1. **Install Python**: If Python is not already installed on your system, download and install the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org). Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

2. **Create a Project Directory**: Use the following command to create a new directory for your project:
    ```bash
    mkdir security-log-analyzer
    ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate its dependencies. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    cd security-log-analyzer
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment using the command:
    - On Windows:
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. **Initialize the Project**: Initialize a new Python project by creating a `requirements.txt` file that will hold the project's dependencies.
    ```bash
    touch requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Install Dependencies**: Open the `requirements.txt` file in a text editor and add any dependencies or libraries you'll need for log parsing and analysis. For example:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn
    regex
    datetime
    ```
    Then run the following command:
    ```bash

.ENvironment:
  - Python
  - Project Directory: security-log-analyzer
  - Virtual Environment: venv
  - Dependencies: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, regex, datetime
  - Log File: app.log

### Steps to Set up the Development Environment and Initialize a Python Project

1. **Install Python**
   If Python is not already installed on your system, download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org). Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

2. **Create a Project Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir security-log-analyzer
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
   ```bash
   cd security-log-analyzer
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   If you face issues with PowerShell execution policies, you can change the execution policy to allow running scripts using the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

   Then, try activating the virtual environment again using the command:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. **Initialize the Project**
   ```bash
   touch requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Install Dependencies**
   Open the `requirements.txt` file in a text editor and add the following dependencies or libraries:
   
   ```
   pandas
   numpy
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   scikit-learn
   regex
   datetime
   ```

   Install the specified dependencies into your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Set Up Logging (Windows)**
   Create a Python file, e.g., `main.py`, and set up logging configuration.

   ```python
   import logging

   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
   logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

   # Create a file handler
   file_handler = logging.FileHandler('app.log', mode='w')
   file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

   # Create a console handler
   console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
   console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)

   # Create a formatter and add it to the handlers
   formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
   file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
   console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

   # Add the handlers to the logger
   logger.addHandler(file_handler)
   logger.addHandler(console_handler)
   ```

8. **Start Coding**
   Implement the core functionalities of your Security Log Analyzer in Python. Begin by writing code to collect, parse, and analyze the system logs based on your requirements and objectives.
   
Remember to regularly save your code changes and commit them to a version control system like Git. This ensures that you can track your progress, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions if needed.
By following these steps, you'll have set up the development environment and initialized a Python project for your Security Log Analyzer.
```python
import logging
import re

def parse_logs(log_file_path):
    # Regular expression patterns for log parsing
    ip_pattern = r'\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}'
    date_pattern = r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}'
    time_pattern = r'\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}'

    # Define a list to store parsed log entries
    parsed_logs = []

    # Read the log file
    with open(log_file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Extract relevant fields using regex
            match = re.search(f"({ip_pattern}) - ({date_pattern}) ({time_pattern})", line)

            if match:
                ip_address = match.group(1)
                date = match.group(2)
                time = match.group(3)

                # Perform further analysis or event detection here
                # Example: Check for suspicious IP addresses
                if is_suspicious_ip(ip_address):
                    logging.warning(f"Suspicious IP detected: {ip_address} - Date: {date} - Time: {time}")

                # Add the parsed log entry to the list
                parsed_logs.append({
                    'ip_address': ip_address,
                    'date': date,
                    'time': time,
                    'raw_entry': line.strip()
                })

    return parsed_logs

def is_suspicious_ip(ip_address):
    # Implement your own logic to determine if an IP address is suspicious
    # Example: Check against a list of known malicious IP addresses or apply custom heuristics
    suspicious_ips = ['10.0.0.1', '192.168.0.100']
    return ip_address in suspicious_ips

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Specify the path to the log file you want to parse
    log_file_path = 'path/to/your/log/file.log'

    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='app.log', filemode='w',
                        format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

    # Call the log parsing function
    parsed_logs = parse_logs(log_file_path)

    # Display the parsed log entries
    for log in parsed_logs:
        logging.debug(f"Parsed log entry: {log}")

    # Perform additional analysis or event detection based on the parsed logs
    # Add your own logic here

    # Example: Count the number of parsed logs
    num_logs = len(parsed_logs)
    logging.info(f"Number of parsed logs: {num_logs}")
```

In this version:
1. Regular Expression Patterns: The regular expression patterns (`ip_pattern`, `date_pattern`, `time_pattern`) are provided as examples. They can match the common formats of IP addresses, dates, and times found in log entries. You can modify them if needed.
2. Suspicious IP Detection: The `is_suspicious_ip()` function checks if an IP address is suspicious. In this example, a list of known suspicious IP addresses (`suspicious_ips`) is provided. You can customize this list by adding IP addresses that you consider suspicious.
3. Log File Path: The `log_file_path` variable is set to `'path/to/your/log/file.log'`. Replace this with the actual path to the log file you want to parse.
4. Logging Configuration: Logging is configured with the basic configuration provided in the code. Logs are written to the `app.log` file. You can modify the logging configuration
 (e.g., log level, log file name) to suit your needs.
5. Additional Analysis: The code includes a placeholder for additional analysis or event detection based on the parsed logs. You can add your own logic within the provided section.
Remember to customize the code further based on your specific log format, analysis requirements, and the definition of suspicious IP addresses.

Version 1.1:
Evaluate Existing Log Parsing Logic:
•	Reviewed the current log parsing logic implemented in the parse_logs() function.
•	Identified limitations or areas where the parsing logic can be improved.
•	Tested the existing logic with various log formats and check if it accurately extracts the relevant fields.
•	Added visual changes for readability
