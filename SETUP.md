Sure! Here's an example of how you can write and format the `SETUP.md` file for GitHub:

```
# Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your local development environment for running the code successfully. Please follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment (if created).

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required Python packages using pip.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install the necessary packages: matplotlib, geopandas, and pandas.

## Running the Code

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can now run the code. Make sure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment (if created) is activated.

```bash
python your_code.py
```

Replace `your_code.py` with the actual name of your code file.

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up your local development environment and installed the required packages (matplotlib, geopandas, and pandas) to run the code. Now you are ready to execute the program and explore its functionalities.

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, please refer to the project's documentation or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance.

Happy coding!
