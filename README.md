# Security Log Analyzer

## Overview

This project, "Security Log Analyzer", is a Python-based tool designed to help system administrators and security professionals analyze, understand, and derive meaningful insights from security logs. Leveraging the power of Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, it parses and analyzes logs, detecting patterns, anomalies, and potential security threats.

Understanding and interpreting system logs are vital to maintaining the security and optimal performance of any system. However, the volume and complexity of system logs can often make it challenging to spot crucial insights manually. The Security Log Analyzer aims to simplify this process, enabling swift identification of security incidents or potential weaknesses.

## Features

- **Log Parsing:** Uses regular expressions to parse logs, extracting essential details such as IP addresses, timestamps, event types, etc.
- **Data Analysis:** Utilizes Pandas and NumPy to clean, preprocess, and analyze parsed data.
- **Visualization:** Leverages Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual representation of the analyzed data, making it easier to understand patterns and trends.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Applies machine learning algorithms from the Scikit-learn library to detect anomalies and potential security threats in the logs.

## Setting Up

The project comes with a detailed setup guide that assists in creating the Python environment, installing necessary dependencies, and running the application. It also includes the recommended logging setup and Python implementation samples to start working on.
